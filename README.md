### ABOUT THE GAME

"Investor" is an investing/trading simulation game — defined, designed, produced in Python (programming language) — that enables players to learn the risks and rewards involved in the decision-making and risk-taking of financial markets. Players start off with a balance of $100,000 to invest and grow their money through their chosen asset(s) to accomplish the goal to win the challenge by achieving $1,000,000 (needs to be in cash balance, not portfolio value). A fully randomised set of economic events will be presented to players, and they will be given the option to buy, hold, or sell.

In order to win the game, players must search for clues in the news, read between the lines, and play some hunches. The game will end once the player has beaten the challenge, or run out of money. They may type QUIT at any time to leave the game.
